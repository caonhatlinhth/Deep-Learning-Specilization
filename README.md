**Deep Learning Specialization**

This repository contains all the code, projects, assignments, and datasets from my Deep Learning Specialization course (Andrew Ng.). The specialization focused on fundamental concepts and cutting-edge applications of deep learning using Python and popular deep learning framework - TensorFlow.

**Content**
- Code: Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and TensorFlow code files containing the implementations of various deep learning architectures and algorithms. This includes, but is not limited to, feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based models.
- Datasets: Datasets used for the assignments and projects, spanning a wide range of domains including natural language processing, computer vision, etc.
- Figures: Graphs, charts, and other visual representations generated during the data analysis and model training/testing processes.

**Specialization Topics**

The Deep Learning Specialization course covered a broad array of topics, including:
- Basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Sequence Models

**Dependencies**

The code in this repository may require the following Python libraries:

- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- TensorFlow: For creating and training deep learning models.
- Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- Other libraries as specified in the respective code files.
